# GENERIC DOUBLY LINKED LIST

### Desc:
    Doubly linked list API written in C that
can take an data type. Should be compatible with C++
too.

### How to use:
    - Run: gcc -c -g dll.c
    - Compile your C/C++ program with object file
        (i.e. gcc main.c dll.o)

### TODO:
    - Create Makefile to create library object file
    - Improve documentation
    - Extend API (i.e. more functionality, like inserting
        new elements anywhere in the linked)
